# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- ESLint (flat config) + Prettier + `npm run lint` / `npm run format`
- TypeScript tooling (`tsconfig.json`, `npm run typecheck`) and initial
  migration of `src/utils/schema.ts` with full type annotations. Shared
  domain types in `src/types.d.ts`.
- Vitest + 44 unit tests covering `data.js`, `utils/biweekly`, and
  `utils/schema`. New `npm run test` / `test:watch` scripts.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow running lint, typecheck, test, build.
- `ErrorBoundary` at app root with a graceful fallback screen.
- Toast system (`useToasts` + `ToastContainer`) with success/error/info
  variants for feedback on save/delete/import/export.
- `useConfirm` promise-based replacement for `window.confirm()` using
  the in-app Modal, including a `danger` tone.
- Import loading state and structural validation of export bundles via
  `validateExportBundle` and `migrateExportBundle`.
- Cascade delete for substitutes when their referenced slot is removed.
- Schema versioning (`schemaVersion`, `exportedAt`) in export bundles.
- Design tokens in `src/styles/tokens.js`, exposed as CSS custom
  properties on `:root` via `main.jsx`.
- Web manifest (`public/manifest.webmanifest`) and meta tags
  (description, OpenGraph, theme-color, favicon) in `index.html`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed
- `src/App.jsx` split from a 1,710-line monolith into a ~500-line shell
  + 14 component files under `src/components` and `src/components/views`,
  plus `src/hooks/useLocalStorage.js` and related utilities.
- `Modal` now traps focus (Tab / Shift+Tab), auto-focuses on open, and
  restores focus on close. Adds `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`,
  `aria-labelledby`.
- `Sidebar` is a semantic `<nav>` with `aria-label` and shows an empty
  state when search filters out all teachers.
- Emoji-only buttons across the app now carry `aria-label`s.
- `SlotForm` wires proper `<label htmlFor>` / `<input id>` pairs and
  emits `role="alert"` on inline errors.
- `HolidayManager` adds date validation and toast feedback.
- Several hot paths memoized: `SectionColumn.byTime`, Sidebar per-
  teacher slot counts, App header day-count summary, Dashboard section
  grouping, `SlotCard` / `StatusBadge` wrapped in `React.memo`.
- `MasterView` hover state now uses React state via a memoized
  `MasterSlotCard` component instead of `querySelector` DOM mutation.
  Its filter chain collapses from 4 sequential filters into a single
  pass.
- `useLocalStorage` surfaces load/save failures through an `onError`
  callback; the app displays a toast on quota exhaustion instead of
  silently dropping writes.
- Root `README.md` replaced with a project-relevant description (was
  the GitHub Skills template).
- `LICENSE` copyright holder updated from "GitHub, Inc." to the project
  owner.

### Removed
- 6 GitHub Skills tutorial workflows under `.github/workflows/`.
- `gh-pages` npm dependency and `deploy` script (Actions handles
  deploys).
- Dead `DayBlock` and `SubBadge` components and two unused variables.
- Unused `@types/react*` type declarations (re-added indirectly through
  TypeScript tooling when appropriate).

### Fixed
- Several list components used `key={i}` (array index); replaced with
  stable IDs to prevent React reconciliation bugs when lists mutate
  (SlotCard in DayBlock, SectionColumn, WeekView, MonthView cells,
  MonthView teacherSubs).
